# DIY-3D-Scanner-Additive-Manufacturing--3D-Printing


•	Designed and printed parts for DIY 3D Scanner (two-line laser) using STL files along with calibration
•	Performed a comparative study on performance of handheld laser, two-line laser, and photogrammetry as a 3D scanner
•	Observed the scan time for Handheld la ser as 10mins, Two-line laser as 22mins and photogrammetry as 1hr 12mins
•	Scanning accuracy for Photogrammetry is the best as it has sophisticated image stabilizing inbuilt software
